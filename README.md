# Hello-world
This is an introduction to the use of github account
I appreciate the power of github in organising and managing codes. I am greatly involved in coding using R statistical software for data management. I have buit application that clean data and output any discrepancies within data. Using github, i will be able to track all the changes that i make on my coding. I would love to version control the codes as it grows big. This is why I come to github.
